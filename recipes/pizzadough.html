<img src="../images/pizzadough.jpg" alt="Image of pizza dough" srcset="">
<p>Pizza dough is the foundation of a great pizza, providing a crispy yet soft base <br>
    for your favorite toppings. With simple ingredients and a little patience, you can <br>
    make a perfect pizza crust at home for any occasion. </p>
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>500g all-purpose or bread flour</li>

</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Activate the yeast:</li>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently.</li>
    <li>Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
